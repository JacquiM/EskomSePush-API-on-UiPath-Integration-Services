# EskomSePush API on UiPath Integration Services

EskomSePush has made an API available for use and now allows developers to extract their loadshedding schedules programmatically. There are huge benefits that be realised from inserting that information into processes to assist with decision making. UiPath Integration Services is a good place to bring different data points, connections and triggers together. This repository contains the export of the ESP API setup on Integration Services
